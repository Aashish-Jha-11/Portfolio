Although inspired by the incredible work of Andrew Woan, this portfolio was built entirely from scratchâ€”from modeling and texturing every 3D asset to writing each line of code. Every animation, interaction, and visual detail reflects my own process, experimentation, and dedication to blending technology with creativity.",

          " - *Blender* was used for all 3D stuff (driver animations, baking, modeling, rigging etc.). Notable plugins include MCprep, SimpleBake, and UVPackMaster 3",
          " - *Audacity* was used to convert mp3 files into ogg files for smaller file sizes and retaining quality.",
          " - *Figma* was used to edit baked textures and create custom SVGs.",
          " - *Poly Haven* was used for the HDRI.",
          " - Global state management stores were handled with *zustand*.",
          " - *SCSS* was the choice for the website styles.",
          " - React three fiber and lot's of react three drei helpers were used to speed up the 3D web development process.",
          " - Notable command line tools like *gltf-transform* and *gltfjsx* were used to optimize models for the web and code.",
          " - All meshes utilized *KTX textures* and were created using KTX Software on GitHub.",
          " - Read a lot of documentation. A lot. I really appreciate all of those who spent so much time on the documentation for their tools it really helps out a ton. The react three drei docs are incredible.",
          " - *ChatGPT* helped out with some of the redundant code really well.",
          " - Online viewers like *sandbox.babylonjs.com*, *gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com*, and *gltf-report.com* were incredibly helpful for quickly reviewing model animations and textures, saving a lot of time.",
          " - I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot of things at the moment, but will come back here to update this list. Feel free to reach out to me at *aashishjha1107@gmail.com* if you have any questions!",
